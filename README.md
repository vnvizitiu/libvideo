libvideo (aka VideoLibrary) is a modern .NET library for downloading YouTube videos. It is portable to most platforms and is very lightweight.

## Installation

You can grab a copy of the library [on NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/VideoLibrary) by running:

    Install-Package VideoLibrary

Alternatively, you can try building the repo if you like your assemblies extra-fresh.

## Supported Platforms

- .NET Framework 4.5+
- Windows 10 Universal apps
- Portable Class Libraries
- Xamarin.iOS
- Xamarin.Android
- Mono (Mac/Linux)
- Windows 8.1 and 8.0
- Windows Phone 8.1

## Getting Started

Here's a small sample to help you get familiar with libvideo:

```csharp
using VideoLibrary;

void SaveVideoToDisk(string link)
{
    var youTube = YouTube.Default; // starting point for YouTube actions
    var video = youTube.GetVideo(link); // gets a Video object with info about the video
    File.WriteAllBytes(@"C:\" + video.FullName, video.GetBytes());
}
```

Or, if you use Visual Basic:

```vbnet
Imports VideoLibrary

Sub SaveVideoToDisk(ByVal link As String)
     Dim video = YouTube.Default.GetVideo(link)
     File.WriteAllBytes("C:\" & video.FullName, video.GetBytes())
End Sub
```

## FAQ

### What's the difference between libvideo and YoutubeExtractor?

libvideo:

- Can be used in Portable Class Libraries
- Supports WinRT projects (e.g. Windows 10)
- Is roughly 400% faster ([yes, it's true](tests/Speed.Test/Speed.Test/Program.cs))

YoutubeExtractor:

- Supports Silverlight
- Supports Flash audio extraction

### Can I switch from YoutubeExtractor without having to refactor my code?

Absolutely! Check out our [libvideo.compat](https://www.nuget.org/packages/VideoLibrary.Compat/) package. It has the same API as YoutubeExtractor, but uses libvideo as its backend so your application will get a major speed boost.

### Do you accept donations?

Thanks! I'm flattered, but it's not really necessary. If anything, you should donate to the creator of [YoutubeExtractor](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=daume%2edennis%40gmail%2ecom&lc=US&item_name=YoutubeExtractor&no_note=0&currency_code=USD&bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donate_LG%2egif%3aNonHostedGuest), because this project wouldn't have happened if it weren't for him.
